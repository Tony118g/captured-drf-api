# Captured - API

Captured is a content sharing platform for photographers. Users can showcase their own photographs along with details concerning them and interact with other users via likes, comments and follows. The site is also used as an advertising platform for the site admin to share photographic tour opportunities that users can choose to attend.

This repository contains the backend API setup built to support the ReactJS frontend and is powered by the Django Rest Framework.
